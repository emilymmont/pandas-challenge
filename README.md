# pandas-challenge
I took what I've learned about Python Pandas and applied it to a situation analyzing in-game purchase data for a video game. I completed this Data Challenge in whick I determined the number of players  making in-game purchases by individual screen name (SN), who the top spenders were, what the most popular/profitable in-game items for purchase were and I analyzed what players purchased by gender identity and age.
